/*
  üå± WELCOME TO OREGANO üå±
  A tiny blogging system, designed to help you post from wherever you are. 

  Made by Tyler Robertson: https://tyler.robertson.click
  Using Glitch: https://glitch.com
  & Express: https://expressjs.com 
  & Pug: https://pugjs.org
  & Showdown: http://showdownjs.com

  üí° HOW IT WORKS üí°
  To get started, remix or clone this site, and adjust the SITE SETTINGS (below) to
  make it your own. You can also edit /pages/index.md to customize your home page,
  /css/style.css to change how the site looks, and the files in /views adjust how 
  content is rendered.

  To publish content in Oregano, write a markdown (.md) file, and place it in either 
  the "pages" or "posts" folder. 

  "Pages" are considered evergreen content, and can be linked to directly. 
  For example, if you write "about.md" and add it to the "pages" folder,
  you can link to it at https://yourSiteURL.com/about. 

  "Posts" are part of your blog, are listed on the index page, and can be linked to at 
  https://yourSiteURL.com/read/your-post. The first line of your post's content
  is considered its title, and is used to create that link. For example, if
  you write a post that starts, "hello, world üëã", it will be available at
  https://yourSiteURL.com/read/hello-world-üëã

  ‚öôÔ∏è SITE SETTINGS ‚öôÔ∏è

  Change the values below to make the site your own!
  
  Not shown here is the KEY value, which you'll need in order to integrate your blog 
  with third-party apps. Set that in your ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES. 
  In Glitch, you can get to ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES by selecting "üîë.env" in the sidebar!
  
  You'll also want to edit /pages/index.md, to personalize your home page.
*/ 

const site = {
  title: "Oregano", // Your site's title appears at the top of every page
  description: "Super simple blogging for writers who don't have the thyme. üå±", // A brief description of your site, appears in search results

  ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED STUFF ‚ö†Ô∏è

  This is where we include the stuff that helps Oregano run:
    * FS lets us access the File System, so we can read and write posts
    * Express lets us listen for requests at the endpoints we define below
    * Showdown turns markdown into HTML
    * Pug helps us render HTML dynamically
    
  You probably won't want to change anything here, unless you know what you're doing.

/* 
  üîë AUTHORIZATION üîë

  Any time you want to connect your Oregano site to a third-party app, you can
  make a GET request to https://yourSiteURL.com/auth, and include a "key" value
  in the query. If that key matches the key that you set in ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES,
  then you're good to go! That means that your key is correct, and you can use the
  other functions listed below successfully. 
*/

/*
  üìö ALL POSTS üìö
  
  Whether you want to scroll through all of your posts, get an RSS feed, or send
  posts to a third-party app, going to https://yourSiteURL.com/all is the place to start. 
  
  By default, it will render an HTML list of all of your posts. But, you can add a "format"
  value to the query, to change how the posts are displayed. 
  
  For RSS: https://yourSiteURL.com/all?format=rss
  For JSON: https://yourSiteURL.com/all?format=json
*/

/*
  üîç SEARCH üîç
  
  Want to find a specific post? Head to https://yourSiteURL.com/search
  
  By default, that will render an HTML page with a search bar and list of results. 
  If you want to return the results as JSON instead (such as for a third-party app), 
  you can specify "q" and "format" in the query. 
  
  For example, to return posts that contain "test" as JSON, use: 
  
  https://yourSiteURL.com/search?q=test&format=json
  
  To limit the number of results, you can add a "limit" value to the query.
  So to get only the top result for "test", use:
  
  https://yourSiteURL.com/search?q=test&format=json&limit=1
*/

  When you go to https://yourSiteURL.com/read/post-title, this code looks for a
  file in the "posts" folder called "post-title.md". If it exists, we render it
  in HTML. If it doesn't, you get redirected back to the index page.

/*
  ü§´ HIDDEN ü§´

/*
  üìÑ PAGES üìÑ
  
  Pages are considered "evergreen" content, and exist outside the regular blog. 
  For example, an "About Me" page would be a good thing to put in the "pages" folder. 
  
  When someone goes to https://yourSiteURL.com/page-title, this code looks for a 
  file in the "pages" folder called "page-title.md". If it exists, we render it 
  in HTML. Otherwise, you get redirected back to the index page.

/*
  üè† INDEX üè†
  
  When you visit https://yourSiteURL.com, we render the "index.md" file in your "pages" folder.
*/

    prev: p > 1 ? p-1 : null,
    site: site
  });
});

/*
  ‚úèÔ∏è WRITE ‚úèÔ∏è
  
  While you can always publish posts by adding markdown files directly to the "posts" folder,
  you can also use third-party apps to send a POST request to https://yourSiteURL.com/write to 
  publish remotely!
  
  When you do that, you'll need to include your "key" and "markdown" in the request body. For example:

  {
    key: "super-secret-key",
    markdown: "# Hello, world üëã \n This is a brand new post on my site!"
  }
  
  The "key" helps make sure you're authorized to publish here, and is set in your ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.
  
  The "markdown" is the raw markdown content you want to post. The first line of that content is then
  used as the post's title and filename. If the first line doesn't include any discernable text 
  (for example, if it's an image), we'll use the current timestamp as the filename instead.
*/

/*
  üìù UPDATE üìù
  
  If you've already written a post, and want to update its content without changing its filename,
  you can send PUT a request to https://yourSiteURL.com/update
  
  In the request, you'll need to include your "key", "markdown", and the "id" of the post you want to
  update. For example, if you want to update "hello-world.md", you would send:
